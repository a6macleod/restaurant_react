This project was a crash course introduction to React. Specifically, this was to re-create a prevous project using React instead of vanailla javascript. 

The project used was a restaurant app that can cycle through the pages by re-rendering the content section rather than creating a new page. 

These projects were created from assignments from The Odin Project. 



## Available Scripts from React
### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
### `npm run build` fails to minify
